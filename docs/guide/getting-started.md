# Getting Started

Smocker exposes two ports:

- `8080` is the mock server port. It will expose the routes you register through the configuration port.
- `8081` is the configuration port. It's the port you will use to register new mocks. This port also exposes a user interface.

To get a better understanding of how Smocker works, let's open its user interface on the browser. With the default configuration, it will be available on [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)

If you take a look at the sidebar on the left, you can see a list of sessions with one selected element.

![Smocker's user interface - Sessions sidebar](/screenshots/screenshot-sessions.png)

By default, Smocker will automatically create a **session** on the first call trying to retrieve **history** or **mocks**.
But you can also create one using the [API](/docs/technical-documentation/api#start-session).
Smocker shows the history of the calls made to the mock server for the selected session. As we just started it, nothing is displayed yet.

Let's see how Smocker reacts when we try to call a non existing route. Run the following command in a terminal:

<details>
<summary><code>curl -i localhost:8080/hello/world</code></summary>

```
HTTP/1.1 666 status code 666
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2020 17:25:31 GMT
Content-Length: 206

{"message":"No mock found matching the request","request":{"path":"/hello/world","method":"GET","body":"","headers":{"Accept":["*/*"],"User-Agent":["curl/7.54.0"]},"date":"2020-01-29T17:25:31.956225978Z"}}
```

</details>

If you refresh Smocker's user interface, you will see that it now displays an entry in the history:

Let's look closer at the call:

- on the left, you can see all the details of the request you made: method `GET`, path `/hello/world`, and headers,
- on the right, you can see the response of Smocker: error code `666`, and informations regarding the error.

:::note
Smocker reserves the non HTTP status codes from `600` to `699`. This is because we need an out of protocol way to report Smocker errors, which are different from the standard protocol errors. The explicit list of Smocker custom errors is available [here](/docs/technical-documentation/errors).

To register our first mock, we will use the user interface. Switch to the "Mocks" page and click on the "Add Mock" button.

![Smocker's user interface - Empty mocks page](/screenshots/screenshot-empty-mocks.png)

![Smocker's user interface - Add mocks](/screenshots/screenshot-add-mocks.png)

Mocks are defined using the YAML format. Register the following mock:

```yml
- request:
    method: GET
    path: /hello/world
  response:
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    body: >
      {
        "hello": "Hello, World!"
      }
```

This mock simply states that when an HTTP `GET` call is made on the `/hello/world` path, the mock server must return a basic JSON document.

Now, execute the previous call one more time:

<details>
<summary><code>curl -i localhost:8080/hello/world</code></summary>

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2020 17:40:52 GMT
Content-Length: 30

{
  "hello": "Hello, World!"
}
```

</details>

Once you refresh the user interface, you should notice that this last call is present in the history and that Smocker replied with the response we declared instead of an error!

You can also visualize call history as a **sequence diagram** by clicking on the `visualize` button on the top right of the page.

This covers the basic usage of Smocker, but it was just the beginning! Smocker covers many more topics:

- advanced filters,
- automation,
- dynamic calls,
- proxies,
- contexts,
- and everything you might need to mock your whole environment!

For more details and explanations than just a **Hello World**, we invite you to check the [Real Life Usage](./real-life) section.

And for advanced mocks you can check the [Mock Definition](/docs/technical-documentation/mock-definition) documentation.
