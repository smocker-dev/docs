# Errors

Smocker uses `6XX` errors to clearly split errors due to its own execution from those returned by defined mocks.

Theses errors will only occurs on mock's endpoint started on the port `8080` by default. \
It doesn't concern the [Smocker API](/docs/technical-documentation/api) which will always return standard HTTP errors.

The list of existing Smocker errors is:
